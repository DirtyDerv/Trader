Hey everyone, \nJust been following Solana a bit more closely lately  it feels like the network has been quietly improving in the background. Fewer outages than before, fast and super low-cost transactions, and a noticeable uptick in developer activity. It seems like more serious infrastructure is starting to emerge alongside the usual NFT and DeFi projects.\n\n\nOne thing I’ve noticed is that Solana’s ecosystem is expanding into areas like oracles, storage, and randomness  tools that help make dApps more powerful. Projects like Switchboard have been popping up to fill these roles, offering things like customizable data feeds or on chain randomness. There are others too, but it’s interesting to see how the ecosystem is trying to cover more of the stack, rather than just relying on Ethereum native solutions.\n\n\nJust seeing more diversity in the types of tools available for devs building on Solana, which feels like a healthy sign for the long term.\n\n\nOn the cex side, platforms like bitget have been listing more Solana-based tokens too, which might reflect some broader confidence in the chain's growth. Whether that’s just trend chasing or something deeper, time will tell\n\nAnyone else building on Solana or tracking how it's evolving? Curious what you're seeing in terms of tooling or infrastructure that’s actually helpful. \n",
